- Allows you to jump directly to the API call location in the source code.

- Type >`Show Chai Sutta Spots` and select it.
- The Chai Sutta Explorer panel will display all found API calls, categorized by HTTP method.
- Click on any API call link to navigate directly to the source code location.


## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the Chai Sutta Explorer extension using the following settings:
`chaiSuttaExplorer.ignorePatterns`

Specifies glob patterns to ignore when searching for API calls. This setting helps exclude unnecessary files or directories from the scan.

#### Default Value

```json
{
  "chaiSuttaExplorer.ignorePatterns": [
    "**/node_modules/**",
    "**/dist/**",
    "**/build/**",
    "**/*.test.js",
    "**/*.config.js"
  ]
}
```
How to Configure
- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P on macOS`).
- Type Preferences: Open Settings (JSON) and select it.
- Add or modify the `chaiSuttaExplorer.ignorePatterns` setting as desired. 


## Customizing Method Names

You can customize the display names for different HTTP methods via the `chaiSuttaExplorer.methodInfo` setting. This allows you to personalize the way API methods are represented in the extension.

### How to Configure

   - Click on `Edit in settings.json` to open your settings file in JSON format.

4. **Add Your Custom Names**:
   - Add your custom names for the methods in the JSON file. Here's an example configuration:

    "chaiSuttaExplorer.methodInfo": {
        "GET": {
